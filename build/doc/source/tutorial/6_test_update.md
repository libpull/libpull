# Sending the update

In this last step of the tutorial you will learn how to put all the pieces togeather and send the update to the device.

## Build the update

We first need to create an update with a version higher than the current one.

The version of the update must be setted in the `config.toml` configuration file. It is used by the `firmware_tool` application provided with libpull.

The default firmware version is `0x0001`. To make the update possible we should send to the device a firmware with a version stricly higher than the one already installed. We can, for example, set the version to `0x0002`.

Once we have an higher version we can generate `./make_firmware.sh` script.

This will generate, as before, a firmware containing both the application with the manifest and the bootloader. However, to send an update we want to send only the applicatoin and thus we need to take it from the `firmware` folder where the firmware is generated.

Inside of that folder (located at `~/libpull_tutorial/libpull/build/zephyr/firmware/`) we can find the following files:

- firmware.bin.tmp // The firmware generated by the application build system;
- manifest.bin // The manifest created from it;
- firmware.bin // A binary composed by the manifest + the firmware;

The server must send only the last one, thus we should execute it passing its location.

## Execute the server

The `make run_server` used at the start of the tutorial prepares the server to send a firmware for the Unit Tests. However, we need to send the firware previsouly created, thus we can execute the server with the following commands:

```
$ cd ~/libpull_tutorial/libpull/
$ ./utils/server/server -f build/zephyr/firmware/firmware.bin
```

However, the previous is not sufficient since, until we configure the internal network to route packets from *wpan0* to the localhost, we also need to instruct the server on the IPv6 it should listen to.

The server offers an option to do it:

```
./utils/server/server -A <your_public_ipv6_addr> -f firmware/firmware.bin
```

## Update the device

Once the server is started, you can restart the device and wait for the update process to start. It should start immediately, downloading the manifest and then the whole update.

If the process was correct, you should see an output like this:
