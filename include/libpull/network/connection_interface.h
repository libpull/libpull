 * \brief Interface to connect with the network.
 *
 * This interface must be defined by the library user to match
 * the specific application and platform requirements.
 * The implementation of the following functions is mandatory,
 * however if a method is not supported by the specific
 * connection library the NOT_IMPLEMENTED error must be returned.
 * The interface assumes that a REST protocol is used, such as
 * CoAP or HTTP.
 * The implementation of this module will be used by the component
 * of the Network module to check and download the available firmware.
